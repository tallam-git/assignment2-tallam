### Cricket

Cricket is like a **religion** in India and the players are considered to be **demi-gods**. **It is the most-watched sport in India**. There are many reasons for liking this particular sport, It can be played even in the most congested streets, and with this, people just don't get to watch it. They can actually immerse themselves in it. **It's simply something that unites the Indians like nothing else in the world.**. Sometimes people consider it as un-official national game of **INDIA**. In other words, cricket is not just a game, it's an emotion for Indians.
